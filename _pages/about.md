Dr. Zixuan Yuan is an Assistant Professor at the FinTech Thrust, HKUST (Guangzhou). He received his Ph.D. in Management (Information Technology track) from Rutgers University. His research interests lie in the general area of urban computing and financial applications, particularly in spatiotemporal analysis, meta learning, self-supervised learning, knowledge graphs, and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in POI recommendation, quantitative trading, event-driven investing, and knowledge graph reasoning. I have research experience in multiple industrial research labs, such as IBM Research, Baidu Research, and RavenPack. I have published in refereed journals and conference proceedings, such as IEEE TKDE, IEEE IOTJ, ACM SIGKDD, SIGIR, WWW, and AAAI.
